The deviations from linear graph is called \"noise\" . Now, noise might not be the best term, but it's the term that statisticians use. In our case: It might be that one of them has a great view. The next one has an old house. One has coastal access, which makes it more expensive. One really requires a new kitchen. There might be factors that really effect the house price beyond the size. But if those factors are unincluded, to a statistician that's called \"random noise\" . Let's talk about bar charts as one way to alleviate the problem. In a bar chart, we take our raw data and pull it together. For example, we might say all the data that falls into interval should be summarized by a single value. Such a value would lie halfway in between two data points and form what's called a bar . What is the height in terms of the dollar figure for the very first bar? It's the halfway point between 88,000 and 72,000, which is 80,000. For two points that fall into the third bar. The mean value here is 105,000. If you look at the bar graph, what you'll find is it's a much finer representation of the data. By pooling together multiple data points into an individual bar, you can see that there is a much better way to really understand the dependence of cost to data. While the bar doesn't give you the linear relationship - in fact, in this case, happens to be nonlinear - it really gives you a sense as you go up in house sizes the cost increases, which wasn't obvious from looking at the individual data points. What the bar chart does is it really helps you to pool together groups of data into a single bar and understand global trends . Such global trends might not be that important if you only have six data points, but imagine you have 60,000. With 60,000 data points if you go look at this scatter plot, the individual data tells you very little, jumping in x parameter by a tiny bit might make a jump in y. Yet a bar graph can really help you understand the data. Clearly, one of the things that a statistician does is to use cumulative tools , such as bar graphs, to gain an understanding of the underlying data. Histogram I want to talk briefly about histograms as a special case of a bar chart. The key difference is whereas the bar charts we discussed so far were defined over 2D data, the histograms look at 1D data. That is, there is only one dimension of data that is being plotted. Let me start with an example. Here is a fictitious data set about annual income. Suppose at some company I asked software engineers how much annual income they make. Again, this data set is contrived. Of the nine people I asked, here is the survey of different annual salaries. In the histogram case, I make a bar chart that concerns itself with only one thing, which is called \"frequency\" , which is short for \"count\" , that will group these salaries into three different buckets - from $120,000 on, $130,000 on, and $140,000 on. What the bar chart plots is the frequency at which people asked fall into the different categories. Income Frequency 120000 - 130000 5 130000 - 140000 2 Now, this histogram differs from the bar chart in that the vertical axis is just a frequency count whereas before it might have been a median home sales value. In 1-dimensional data sets that are numerical, this could be informative. You can say, for example the majority of workers in this company are in this salary bracket where as a much smaller number are in higher salary brackets.","title":"Bar Charts"},{"location":"Intro/bar-charts/#histogram","text":"I want to talk briefly about histograms as a special case of a bar chart.

From now on, we're going to study the more interesting cases where the outcome of the first does impact the outcome of the second, and to do so you need to use more variables to express these cases. Medical Example Suppose there's a patient in the hospital who might suffer from a medical condition like cancer. Let's say the probability of having this cancer is 0.1. $$P(Cancer) = 0.1$$ The probability of being cancer free. $$P(\\text{No Cancer}) = 0.9$$ The outcome of the blood test may be positive or negative, but like any good test, it tells me something about the thing I really care about-whether the person has cancer or not. Let's say, if the person has the cancer, the test comes up positive with the probability of 0.9. $$P(\\text{Positive | Cancer}) = 0.9$$ The negative outcome will have 0.1 probability and that's because these two things have to add to 1. $$P(\\text{Negative | Cancer}) = 0.1$$ I've just given you a fairly complicated notation that says the outcome of the test depends on whether the person has cancer or not.

Statistics comes to our rescue - it takes data and turns it into information that we the people can use to make decisions. Whether you are in social sciences, medicine, engineering, public policy, psychology, climatology, robotics, even archaeology, health sciences, finance, business and marketing, or pretty much any other discipline that you can study. All of those are now driven by data, including unlikely fields like biology or physics and so many others. One of the standard problems that people study in statistics has to do with purchasing decisions. Suppose you wish to buy a house - there are small houses and big houses, but you really like this one special house build by a famous designer which has a certain price. In statistics, the way we find out is by looking at data. Let's assume there is a database of previous house sales of homes in the same neighborhood. Just for simplicity, let's assume we know about two things - the size of the home and the cost at which it was sold. Size (sq.ft) Cost ($) 1400 112000 2400 192000 1800 144000 1900 152000 1300 104000 1100 88000 It turns out that this data set has this amazing property that the cost per square foot is constant. $$\\frac{112000}{1400} = 80$ /sq.ft$$ How much money should you expect to pay if you're trying to purchase a house with 2100 & 1500 sq.ft? $$\\frac{144000 + 192000}{2} = 168000$$ 2100 is just halfway between 1800 and 2400. If you take halfway between $144,000 and $192,000 - we get the mean of 144,000 and 192,000 and that is $168,000. $$112000+\\frac{144000 - 112000}{4} = 120000$$ By our logic, 1500 lies between 1400 and 1800. In fact, it's a quarter away from 1400. We'd say it's $112,000 plus 1/4 of the way from 1400 to 1800. But as we go forward, we're going to look into data where the cost might not just be a constant factor times the size of a home.","title":"Looking at Data"},{"location":"Intro/pie-charts/","text":"In statistics you use pie charts to visualize data, specifically relative data.

What it really depicts is the relative number of votes. It shows that A got many, many more votes than B. It shows it graphically, so you can see this without even studying the numbers. Another Example: Party Votes % A 175,000 7/12 B 50,000 2/12 C 25,000 1/12 D 50,000 2/12 As a final question, I will now tell you that in a different election where the same pie chart is correct we had a total of 240,000 voters, which is the sum of all votes cast. Assuming that this pie chart here is correct, can you tell me how many votes are cast for each of the parties? We know that 1/12 is 20,000. So A got 140,000, which is 7 times 20,000. Party B got 2/12 or a 6th, which is 40,000. Party C - a disappointing 20,000. And party D the same as party B. If we look at the diagram, it tell you nothing about the absolute numbers. In fact, I can change the absolute numbers. As long as the relative percentages stay the same, it does however tell you a lot about the distribution of the data. It shows you that A is the dominant party that got more than 50% of the outcome whereas B, C, and D occupies smaller slices with a slice for C being half the size of B or D, respectively.

That is, in half the coin flips, the coin should come up heads. In probability we often write 0.5, which is half of 1. So a probability of 1 means it always occurs. A probability of 0.5 means it occurs half the time.

We conveniently chose a 2-dimensional list to make for a 2-dimensional scatter plot. These are the most popular scatter plots because surfaces like paper are 2-dimensional. It's really hard to do it in like 125 dimensions. Being as it is, when I draw in all the six data points, I get a scatter plot like this. That's a nice scatter plot, because I can draw a line straight through all of the data points. Now when this happens and there's a relationship that's governed by a straight line, we call the data linear . Now, linearity is a rare concept in statistics. Very often you'll find deviations, and that's because the size of the house is not the only determinant in the cost or perhaps because most of us are bad negotiators. But when a data set is linear, it's really easy to predict prices of houses in between. For example, a house of this size ought to cost this much. You can read out of a scatter plot the dependence of the size of a house and its price. Here we are - we're actually looking at the data. We're doing what a statistician ought to do.

Let's pick a random one of your friends. Before I raise the question how many friends this person has, let's consider that this might be either a type A or a type B person. What are the chances you picked a type A friend? What are the chances you picked a type B? This should be a number between 0 and 1 . You link to type A and to type B in a proportion of 80 to 20. Type Proportion A 0.8 B 0.2 That means most of your friends you link to are type A. How many friends does this friend of yours have? The way to get there is with 0.8 chance you'll pick a type A who has 80 friends and with 0.2 chance you'll pick a type B who has 20 friends. $$0.8 * 80 + 0.2 * 20$$ $$64 + 4 = 68$$","title":"Teaser"}]}
